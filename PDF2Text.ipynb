      "\n",
      "5. Compensation \n",
      "\n",
      "  Market Benchmarking: We will use as an input, data based on the industry market – trends, \n",
      "movement, and competition, how each of these affects us and the key things we need to do \n",
      "to accomplish our business goals. These in conjunction with our attrition data, hiring success \n",

      "compensation strategy for the year \n",
      "\n",
      "  Performance Based Pay: The goal is to encourage all employees to achieve a higher level of \n",
      "performance. We believe that we need to drive and recognize higher performance. One of \n",
      "the ways we do this is paying relatively higher compensations to the employees who perform \n",

      "implement this by driving and evaluating performance more stringently \n",
      "\n",
      "  Parity: We want to ensure parity amongst employees performing at similar levels. This is done \n",
      "by  placing  such  employees  within  a  narrow  salary  range  of  each  other.  This  parity  is  also \n",
      "ensured  when  hiring  from  outside.  While  hiring  a  new  employee,  the  compensation  is \n",
      "compared to that of existing employee keeping in mind any change to the existing employee’s \n",
      "compensation in the immediate future. The comparisons are based on trends and not specific \n",

      "\n",
      "  Positioning:  The  compensation  plan  for  the  year  will  be  positioned by taking  into  account \n",

      "work out the positioning for the year. The Compensation Management for the year will be \n",
